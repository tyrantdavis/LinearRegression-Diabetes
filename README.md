# Linear Regression : Predicting Diabetes Progression

---

## Project Objective

This project builds a linear regression model that predicts diabetes progression in patients based on several numeric data points. 

## Data

The data used in this project is from **[sklearn datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/api/sklearn.datasets.html)**.

#### Data Columns

- **age**    - patient's age in years
- **sex**    - patient's gender
- **bmi**    - patient's body mass index
- **bp**     - patient's blood pressure
- **s1**     - patient's blood-serum measurement 1
- **s2**     - patient's blood-serum measurement 2
- **s3**     - patient's blood-serum measurement 3
- **s4**     - patient's blood-serum measurement 4
- **s5**     - patient's blood-serum measurement 5
- **s6**     - patient's blood-serum measurement 6

## Scenario

You are an endocrinologist at a medical facility that provides disease services to diabetics and others to assist in managing a patient's illness. **Your number one priority is predicting when a patient is at risk of progressing the disease**. 


## Strategy

Linear regression is a powerful technique that can be employed to comprehend the relationship between a quantitative variable and one or more other variables, sometimes intending to make predictions.
