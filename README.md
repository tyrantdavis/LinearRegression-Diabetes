# Linear Regression: Predicting Diabetes Progression

---

## Project Objective

This project builds a linear regression model that predicts diabetes progression in patients based on several numeric data points. 

## Data

The data used in this project is from **[sklearn datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/api/sklearn.datasets.html)**.

#### Data Columns

- **age**    - patient's age in years
- **sex**    - patient's gender
- **bmi**    - patient's body mass index
- **bp**     - patient's blood pressure
- **s1**     - patient's blood-serum measurement 1
- **s2**     - patient's blood-serum measurement 2
- **s3**     - patient's blood-serum measurement 3
- **s4**     - patient's blood-serum measurement 4
- **s5**     - patient's blood-serum measurement 5
- **s6**     - patient's blood-serum measurement 6

## Scenario

You are doing consultant work for a medical practice that provides treatment in several different fields including endocrinology. 

The endocrinologist has provided you with an anonymized dataset of past diabetic patients, including various medical attributes that might be indicators of disease progression. You have been asked to assist doctors with their efforts to monitor and anticipate the progression of the disease in patients. 

**Your number one priority is predicting when a patient is at risk of progressing the disease**. 


## Strategy
Given that this is an ordinal numeric Linear Regression will be the model of choice. 

Linear regression is a powerful technique that can be employed to comprehend the relationship between a quantitative variable and one or more other variables, sometimes intending to make predictions.
